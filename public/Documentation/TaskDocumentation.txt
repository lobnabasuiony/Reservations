- Technologies Used :-
   . React with TypeScript.

-Dependencies and Libraries:
  @mui/MuiDataGrid  : Provides Data Grid functionality.

-Development Process:-
    1. Set up a new project using React with TypeScript.
    2. Install necessary dependencies: react, typescript , Material UI.
    3. Establish the structure for the application 
     - /components : Contains all reusable components of the App.
     - /data       : Contains mockup data used in the task.
     - /interface  : Contains all models used in the app to define the structure of data used in the application.
     - /styles     : Contains CSS stylesheets .
    5. Begin development by creating an initial component in the "components" directory (Home.tsx). This will serve as the entry point of our application.
    6.create (ReservationList) component using MuiDataGrid 
    7.create (ReservationListWithoutLibrary) component 
    

 -Notes:-
   -I developed  two components: one utilizing Material UI (Mui) for the table and another without any external libraries.
   -I Prefer the Material UI component due to its time-saving features, readability, and comprehensive functionality.
   -You can simply replace <ReservationList/> with <ReservationListWithoutLibrary/> in Home.tsx file to see the version without using libraries.
